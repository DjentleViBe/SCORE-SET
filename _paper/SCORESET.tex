A curated dataset of Guitar Pro tablature files (.gp5 format), 
tailored for tasks involving guitar music generation, sequence modeling, and 
performance-aware learning is provided. 
The dataset is derived from MIDI notes in \cite{hawthorne2018enabling} and 
\cite{kong2022giantmidipianolargescalemididataset} which have been 
adapted into rhythm guitar tracks. These tracks are 
further processed to include a variety of expression settings typical 
of guitar performance, such as bends, slides, vibrato, and palm muting, 
to better reflect the nuances of real-world guitar playing. Dataset available at 
\cite{SCORESET}.

\section{Introduction}
Advancements in machine learning have led to significant progress in the 
field of automatic music generation, particularly with symbolic representations 
such as MIDI. While datasets like 
\cite{hawthorne2018enabling} 
\cite{7952261} 
\cite{thickstun2017learningfeaturesmusicscratch} 
\cite{bertinmahieux-2011-million} 
\cite{peracha2022jsfakechoralessynthetic}
\cite{bradshaw2025ariamididatasetpianomidi}
\cite{kong2022giantmidipianolargescalemididataset}
have enabled research in mostly piano music generation, there remains a lack of 
large-scale, high-quality resources tailored specifically to the guitarâ€”a highly 
expressive and technically diverse instrument.

Guitar music presents unique challenges for 
modeling due to its polyphonic nature, alternate tunings, and rich 
expressive techniques (e.g., bends, slides, palm muting). Existing symbolic 
music datasets often lack this level of nuance, limiting the development of 
models capable of learning and generating realistic guitar performance.

To address this gap, curated dataset of Guitar Pro tablature files (.gp5 format) is provided 
designed for guitar music generation, sequence modeling, and performance-aware learning. 
The dataset is derived from the MIDI information found in \cite{hawthorne2018enabling} and 
\cite{kong2022giantmidipianolargescalemididataset}, with melodies adapted innto 
rhythm guitar tracks and enriched with expressive elements common in guitar playing.

\section{SCORE-SET Dataset}
MIDI notes provide information about both pitch and timing, specifying when 
a note is played, its duration, and its musical pitch. 
In the context of guitar tablature, the pitch is mapped to an open string and 
fret position, while the duration is quantized to musical beats. The guitar used is a 6-string instrument tuned to F\-C\-G\#\-D\#\-A\#\-D\#. 
Both single notes and chords are automatically encoded along with their corresponding beat durations.

To begin with, an overview of articulations to be used in 
the dataset and their tablature is provided. These are deemed essential for capturing the expressive nuances of 
guitar performance.
\subsection{Expressions}
Accentuation in playing refer to emphasising specific notes or rhythms to create dynamics and expression in music. 
\subsubsection{Palm mute}
Palm mute - A technique of lightly resting the edge of palm on the strings near bridge while plucking or strumming.
\subsubsection{Bends}
Pushing or pulling a string sideways across the fretboard, raising its pitch.

\subsubsection{Tremolo bar}
A tremolo bar or whammy bar is a device attached to the bridge of a guitar that 
allows bending the pitch of notes by pushing or pulling on the bar.

\subsubsection{Slide}
Smoothly moving up or down the fretboard without lifting off on the string, creating a seamless transition between notes.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Dead note}
(muted note or ghost note)
Muting the string to produce a percussive sound.
\subsubsection{Hammer on / pull off}
Allows playing 2 notes in succession without picking the second note. Pressing down onto a higher fret to play a note without picking it, producing smooth legato transition between notes. 
Pulling off a higher fretted note while the lower fret note is still pressed.
\subsubsection{Vibrato}
Repeated bending and releasing a note to create subtle pitch variation
\subsubsection{Harmonic - Natural}
Producing bell-like, chime sound by lightly touching a string at specific points along the fretboard.

In this appendix we prove the following theorem from
Section~6.2:

\noindent
{\bf Theorem} {\it Let $u,v,w$ be discrete variables such that $v, w$ do
not co-occur with $u$ (i.e., $u\neq0\;\Rightarrow \;v=w=0$ in a given
dataset $\dataset$). Let $N_{v0},N_{w0}$ be the number of data points for
which $v=0, w=0$ respectively, and let $I_{uv},I_{uw}$ be the
respective empirical mutual information values based on the sample
$\dataset$. Then
\[
	N_{v0} \;>\; N_{w0}\;\;\Rightarrow\;\;I_{uv} \;\leq\;I_{uw}
\]
with equality only if $u$ is identically 0.} \hfill\BlackBox

\section{}

\noindent
{\bf Proof}. We use the notation:
\[
P_v(i) \;=\;\frac{N_v^i}{N},\;\;\;i \neq 0;\;\;\;
P_{v0}\;\equiv\;P_v(0)\; = \;1 - \sum_{i\neq 0}P_v(i).
\]
These values represent the (empirical) probabilities of $v$
taking value $i\neq 0$ and 0 respectively.  Entropies will be denoted
by $H$. We aim to show that $\fracpartial{I_{uv}}{P_{v0}} < 0$....\\
