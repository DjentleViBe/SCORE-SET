Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit a manuscript titled "SCORE-SET: A dataset of GuitarPro files for Music Phrase Generation and Sequence Learning" for consideration in the Journal of Machine Learning Research.

This paper presents a curated and cleaned collection of Guitar Pro tablature files sourced from publicly available MAESTRO and GiantMIDI datasets. 
The resulting dataset, which I call SCORE-SET, consists of tablatures for guitar instrument. It is intended to serve as a resource for 
symbolic music modeling, transcription, generative models, and multimodal tasks involving guitar as the main instrument.

In addition to releasing the dataset under a permissive license:
- Guitar Expressions are added from statistical analysis of author transcribed tablature from publicly available music sources.
- Preprocessing tools are provided to read MIDI.
- Export functions handle .gp5 output files

I believe the SCORE-SET dataset will be of broad interest to the machine learning community, particularly those working on music understanding, 
generative models, and structured sequence learning with concentration on guitars. 
To my knowledge, it is only symbolic guitar dataset in tablature form with added diverse expressions released to date.

The dataset can be downloaded from the repo : https://github.com/DjentleViBe/SCORE-SET
The submission has not been published or submitted elsewhere. I welcome any feedback and thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Vishakh Begari
